This repo contains codes that use Branch & Bound method (call 'main_BB.m') and Cross Entropy method (call 'main_CE.m')

that solve the combinatorial optimization for connected vehicle selection problem described in:

Macheng Shen, Ding Zhao, and Jing Sun. "Optimization of Vehicle Connections in V2V-based Cooperative Localization." arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.08818 (2017).
